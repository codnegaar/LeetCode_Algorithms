Leetcode 840 Magic Squares In Grid

A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.
Given a row x col grid of integers, how many 3 x 3 contiguous magic square subgrids are there?
Note: while a magic square can only contain numbers from 1 to 9, grid may contain numbers up to 15. 

Example 1:
        Input: grid = [[4,3,8,4],[9,5,1,9],[2,7,6,2]]
        Output: 1
        Explanation: 
                The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:        
                        while this one is not:
                In total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[8]]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

row == grid.length
col == grid[i].length
1 <= row, col <= 10
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15
