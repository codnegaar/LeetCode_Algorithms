1930 Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences

Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.
Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 

Example 1:
        Input: s = "aabca"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
        - "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
        - "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
        - "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")

Example 2:
          Input: s = "adc"
          Output: 0
          Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".

Example 3:
        Input: s = "bbcbaba"
        Output: 4
        Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
        - "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
        - "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
        - "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
        - "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")


Constraints:
        3 <= s.length <= 105
        s consists of only lowercase English letters.
