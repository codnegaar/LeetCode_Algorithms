Leetcode (Detecting Cycles in a Graph) 207 Course Schedule
 
You have to take a total of numCourses courses, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array of 
prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have first to take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:
        Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
        Output: true
        Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
        To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:
        Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
        Output: false
        Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
        To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Constraints:
        1 <= numCourses <= 2000
        0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000
        prerequisites[i].length == 2
        0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
        All the pairs prerequisites[i] are unique.
