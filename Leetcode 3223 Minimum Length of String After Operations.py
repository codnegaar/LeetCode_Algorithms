Leetcode 3223 Minimum Length of String After Operations

You are given a string s.
You can perform the following process on s any number of times:
        Choose an index i in the string such that there is at least one character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i], and at least one character to the right that is also equal to s[i].
        Delete the closest character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i].
        Delete the closest character to the right of index i that is equal to s[i].
        Return the minimum length of the final string s that you can achieve.

Example 1:
        Input: s = "abaacbcbb"
        Output: 5
        Explanation:
                  We do the following operations:
                Choose index 2, then remove the characters at indices 0 and 3. The resulting string is s = "bacbcbb".
                Choose index 3, then remove the characters at indices 0 and 5. The resulting string is s = "acbcb".

Example 2:
        Input: s = "aa"
        Output: 2
        Explanation: We cannot perform any operations, so we return the length of the original string.
        
Constraints:
        1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
        s consists only of lowercase English letters.
