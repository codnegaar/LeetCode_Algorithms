Leetcode 2185 Counting Words With a Given Prefix
 
You are given an array of strings words and a string pref.
Return the number of strings in words that contain pref as a prefix.
A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s. 

Example 1:
        Input: words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at"
        Output: 2
        Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".

Example 2:
        Input: words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
        Output: 0
        Explanation: There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.
         
Constraints:
        1 <= words.length <= 100
        1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100
        words[i] and pref consist of lowercase English letters.
