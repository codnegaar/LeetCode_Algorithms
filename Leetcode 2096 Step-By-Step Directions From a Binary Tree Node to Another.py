Leetcode 2096 Step-By-Step Directions From a Binary Tree Node to Another

You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is uniquely assigned a value from 1 to n. You are also given an integer startValue representing the value of the start node s, and a different integer destValue representing the value of the destination node t.

Find the shortest path starting from node s and ending at node t. Generate step-by-step directions of such path as a string consisting of only the uppercase letters 'L', 'R', and 'U'. Each letter indicates a specific direction:        
        'L' means to go from a node to its left child node.
        'R' means to go from a node to its right child node.
        'U' means to go from a node to its parent node.
        Return the step-by-step directions of the shortest path from node s to node t.

 

Example 1:        
        Input: root = [5,1,2,3,null,6,4], startValue = 3, destValue = 6
        Output: "UURL"
        Explanation: The shortest path is: 3 → 1 → 5 → 2 → 6.

Example 2:
        Input: root = [2,1], startValue = 2, destValue = 1
        Output: "L"
        Explanation: The shortest path is: 2 → 1.
 
Constraints:
        The number of nodes in the tree is n.
        2 <= n <= 105
        1 <= Node.val <= n
        All the values in the tree are unique.
        1 <= startValue, destValue <= n
        startValue != destValue
