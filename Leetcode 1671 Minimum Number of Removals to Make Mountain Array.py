Leetcode 1671 Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array

You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:

arr.length >= 3
There exists some index i (0-indexed) with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
Given an integer array nums​​​, return the minimum number of elements to remove to make nums​​​ a mountain array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array itself is a mountain array so we do not need to remove any elements.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,1,5,6,2,3,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: One solution is to remove the elements at indices 0, 1, and 5, making the array nums = [1,5,6,3,1].
 

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
It is guaranteed that you can make a mountain array out of nums.
