Leetcode 1975 Maximum Matrix Sum

You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:
        Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.
        Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.
Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.

Example 1:
          Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]]
          Output: 4
          Explanation: We can follow the following steps to reach sum equals 4:
          - Multiply the 2 elements in the first row by -1.
          - Multiply the 2 elements in the first column by -1.
          
Example 2:
        Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3],[1,2,3]]
        Output: 16
        Explanation: We can follow the following step to reach sum equals 16:
        - Multiply the 2 last elements in the second row by -1.
 
Constraints:
        n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
        2 <= n <= 250
        -105 <= matrix[i][j] <= 105
