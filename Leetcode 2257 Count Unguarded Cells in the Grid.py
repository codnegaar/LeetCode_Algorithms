Leetcode 2257 Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid

You are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [rowi, coli] and walls[j] = [rowj, colj] represent the positions of the ith guard and jth wall respectively.
A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.
Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.

Example 1:
        Input: m = 4, n = 6, guards = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]], walls = [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]]
        Output: 7
        Explanation: The guarded and unguarded cells are shown in red and green respectively in the above diagram.
        There are a total of 7 unguarded cells, so we return 7.

Example 2:
        Input: m = 3, n = 3, guards = [[1,1]], walls = [[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[1,2]]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: The unguarded cells are shown in green in the above diagram.
        There are a total of 4 unguarded cells, so we return 4.
         

Constraints:
        1 <= m, n <= 105
        2 <= m * n <= 105
        1 <= guards.length, walls.length <= 5 * 104
        2 <= guards.length + walls.length <= m * n
        guards[i].length == walls[j].length == 2
        0 <= rowi, rowj < m
        0 <= coli, colj < n
        All the positions in guards and walls are unique.

        Calculate the number of unguarded cells in a grid given the positions of guards and walls.

        Parameters:
        m (int): Number of rows in the grid.

        guards (list[list[int]]): List of [row, col] positions for the guards.
        walls (list[list[int]]): List of [row, col] positions for the walls.
