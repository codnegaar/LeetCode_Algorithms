7. Check if two binary trees are identical
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not. Two binary trees are considered the same 
if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

solution:
 
Runtime complexity: O(N)
Space complexity: O(N)
 

This problem can be tackled using recursion. The base case of the recursive solution would be when both nodes being compared are null or one of them is null.

Two trees being compared are identical if:

data on their roots is the same
the left sub-tree of ‘A’ is identify to the left sub-tree of ‘B’
the right sub-tree of ‘A’ is identical to the right sub-tree of ‘B’
Using recursion, we can solve this problem through a depth-first traversal on both trees simultaneously while comparing the data at each node.
